# Fraud Detection Analysis

## Introduction

This Jupyter notebook project aims to perform a comprehensive analysis of a financial fraud dataset. The dataset contains information about various financial transactions, including details such as the transaction type, amount, origin and destination accounts, and whether the transaction was fraudulent or not.

The primary objective of this analysis is to gain insights into the characteristics and patterns of fraudulent transactions, with the ultimate goal of developing a robust fraud detection model. By understanding the factors and behaviors associated with fraudulent activities, we can potentially build predictive models to identify and prevent such fraudulent activities in the future.

The analysis will involve the following key steps:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Thoroughly examine the dataset to understand the distribution, relationships, and anomalies within the data. This will involve analyzing the statistical properties of the numerical features, visualizing the data, and identifying any potential issues or areas requiring further investigation.

2. **Feature Engineering**: Identify and create new features from the existing data that may provide additional insights or improve the model's performance. This could include engineering derived features, handling missing values, and addressing any data quality concerns.

3. **Model Development and Evaluation**: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting, to build predictive models for fraud detection. Evaluate the performance of these models using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, to identify the most effective approach.

4. **Model Optimization and Deployment**: Fine-tune the selected model by tuning hyperparameters and incorporating feature importance analysis. Ensure the model's robustness and generalizability, and prepare it for deployment in a real-world setting.

5. **Reporting and Presentation**: Summarize the findings, insights, and recommendations in a clear and concise manner, suitable for presentation to stakeholders or decision-makers.

By leveraging this Jupyter notebook project, we aim to contribute to the ongoing efforts in the field of financial fraud detection, providing valuable insights and a practical framework for identifying and mitigating fraudulent activities.

## Dataset Dictionary

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `step` | Maps a unit of time in the real world. In this case, 1 step is 1 hour of time. Total steps: 744 (30 days simulation). |
| `type` | Transaction type: `CASH-IN`, `CASH-OUT`, `DEBIT`, `PAYMENT`, and `TRANSFER`. |
| `amount` | Amount of the transaction in local currency. |
| `nameOrig` | Customer who started the transaction. |
| `oldbalanceOrg` | Initial balance before the transaction. |
| `newbalanceOrig` | New balance after the transaction. |
| `nameDest` | Customer who is the recipient of the transaction. |
| `oldbalanceDest` | Initial balance of the recipient before the transaction. Note that there is no information for customers that start with 'M' (Merchants). |
| `newbalanceDest` | New balance of the recipient after the transaction. Note that there is no information for customers that start with 'M' (Merchants). |
| `isFraud` | Indicates whether the transaction was made by fraudulent agents inside the simulation. The fraudulent behavior aims to profit by taking control of customers' accounts and trying to empty the funds by transferring to another account and then cashing out of the system. |
| `isFlaggedFraud` | Indicates whether the business model has flagged the transaction as an illegal attempt. An illegal attempt in this dataset is an attempt to transfer more than 200,000 in a single transaction. |
