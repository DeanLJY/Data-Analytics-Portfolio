# Customer Analytics Framework

Welcome to the Customer Analytics Framework project! This project is a comprehensive effort to provide businesses the ability to understand their customers better, segment them based on various characteristics and behaviors, and ultimately develop more effective strategies for marketing, sales, customer service, and overall business growth.

## Project Overview

This project is divided into four main parts, each captured in a Jupyter notebook. Here's a brief overview of each notebook:

1. **Hierarchical Customer Segmentation Analysis**: This notebook focuses on dividing customers into groups based on their purchasing behavior using a Hierarchical Clustering approach. By understanding the similar characteristics within these groups, businesses can tailor their strategies to meet the needs of each customer segment effectively.

2. **Managerial Approach to Customer Segmentation**: This notebook delves deeper into customer segmentation using a managerial approach. It implements RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis to categorize customers into different segments. It also provides a retrospective analysis function that can generate customer segmentation for any given historical moment.

3. **Customer Scoring and Behavior Analysis**: This notebook develops a scoring model for customers based on their behavior and characteristics. It emphasizes on RFM analysis and prepares the model to predict future customer behavior, a critical input for strategic decision-making in marketing and customer relationship management.

4. **Calculating and Analyzing Customer Lifetime Value**: The last notebook in this project focuses on the calculation and analysis of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). By analyzing CLV, businesses can identify their most valuable customers, optimize marketing efforts, and improve customer retention strategies.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the necessary Python libraries such as `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy.cluster.hierarchy`, and `scikit-learn`. Each notebook is well-documented and guides you through the process step-by-step.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, you will have a good understanding of how to load and manipulate data for customer segmentation, visualize data, understand the concept of RFM in the context of customer segmentation, categorize customers into different segments, and perform retrospective analysis to understand customer behavior over time.

This project aims to provide a strong basis for any business to understand their customers better and make data-driven decisions that will ultimately lead to increased customer satisfaction, retention, and business growth.
