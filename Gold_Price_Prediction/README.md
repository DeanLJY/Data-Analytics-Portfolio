# Gold Price Data Analysis

This Jupyter notebook project explores the historical daily gold price data from 2008 to 2021. The goal is to use hidden Markov models to analyze the changes in gold prices and identify different volatility regimes.

## Introduction

The gold market is an important global commodity market that plays a significant role in financial markets and the overall economy. Understanding the dynamics and patterns in gold prices can provide valuable insights for investors, traders, and policymakers.

In this project, we will use a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to analyze the daily changes in gold prices. HMMs are a powerful tool for modeling time series data with underlying hidden states, which can be useful for capturing the different volatility regimes in the gold market.

The key steps in this analysis are:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We will load the daily gold price data, clean and preprocess the data, and create features for the analysis.
2. **Hidden Markov Model**: We will build a Gaussian HMM to model the daily changes in gold prices and identify the underlying hidden volatility states.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: We will analyze the characteristics of the identified volatility regimes, such as the transition probabilities, emission probabilities, and the corresponding price changes.
4. **Insights and Implications**: Based on the HMM analysis, we will discuss the potential insights and implications for understanding the gold market dynamics and potential applications for investment and risk management.

By the end of this project, we will have a better understanding of the gold market's behavior and the ability to apply HMMs to analyze time series data with hidden states.

## Data

The data for this project is a CSV file containing the daily closing gold prices in US dollars from 2008 to 2021. The dataset (see **dataset.zip**) includes the following features:

- `datetime`: The date of the gold price observation.
- `gold_price_usd`: The closing gold price in US dollars.
- `gold_price_change`: The daily change in the gold price.

The data has been preprocessed and is ready for analysis.

## Technical Approach

In this project, we will use a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to analyze the daily changes in gold prices. HMMs are a powerful tool for modeling time series data with underlying hidden states, which can be useful for capturing the different volatility regimes in the gold market.

The key steps in the technical approach are:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We will load the daily gold price data, clean and preprocess the data, and create features for the analysis.
2. **Hidden Markov Model**: We will build a Gaussian HMM to model the daily changes in gold prices and identify the underlying hidden volatility states.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: We will analyze the characteristics of the identified volatility regimes, such as the transition probabilities, emission probabilities, and the corresponding price changes.
4. **Insights and Implications**: Based on the HMM analysis, we will discuss the potential insights and implications for understanding the gold market dynamics and potential applications for investment and risk management.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end of this project, we will have:

1. A better understanding of the gold market's behavior and the different volatility regimes.
2. The ability to apply Hidden Markov Models to analyze time series data with hidden states.
3. Insights and implications for understanding the gold market dynamics and potential applications for investment and risk management.

## Conclusion

This Jupyter notebook project provides a comprehensive analysis of the historical daily gold price data using a Gaussian Hidden Markov Model. The insights gained from this analysis can be valuable for investors, traders, and policymakers in understanding the gold market's dynamics and informing their decision-making processes.
