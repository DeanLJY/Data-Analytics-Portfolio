## Covid-19 Data Analysis

This Jupyter notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using data from Worldometers. The notebook includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to provide insights into the spread and impact of the virus.

### Data Source

The data used in this notebook is obtained from the Worldometers website, which provides real-time updates on the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries from COVID-19 worldwide.

### Data Cleaning

The raw data is cleaned to remove unnecessary characters and format it into a structured format. Regular expressions are used to extract data for each country, and missing values are imputed with zeros.

### Data Visualization

The cleaned data is visualized using various plots and charts to provide insights into the pandemic's progression. These visualizations include:

- **Time Series Plots:** Line charts showing the daily number of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries over time.
- **Bar Charts:** Bar charts comparing the total number of cases, deaths, and recoveries across different countries.
- **Choropleth Maps:** Maps showing the geographic distribution of cases, deaths, and recoveries.

### Statistical Analysis

The data is also analyzed statistically to identify trends and patterns. This includes:

- **Correlation Analysis:** Correlation coefficients are calculated to determine the relationship between different variables, such as the number of cases and population density.
- **Regression Analysis:** Regression models are used to predict the future number of cases and deaths based on historical data.
- **Clustering Analysis:** Clustering algorithms are used to group countries based on their similarities in terms of COVID-19 data.

### Conclusion

This Jupyter notebook provides a comprehensive analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using data from Worldometers. The data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis techniques employed in this notebook allow us to gain valuable insights into the spread and impact of the virus. These insights can be used to inform decision-making and develop strategies to mitigate the effects of the pandemic.
